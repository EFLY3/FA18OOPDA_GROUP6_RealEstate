# FA18OOPDA_GROUP6_RealEstate

10/17/18 - Hey guys, I uploaded the Property class and subclasses I was working on. They need work, but they should 
give us a starting point. I wanted their toStrings to be basic for file output reasons and maybe make it easier to
read the variables with less fluff. I only wrote default constructors, and will add more once we get a feel for how we 
want to populate each class. - Rich
