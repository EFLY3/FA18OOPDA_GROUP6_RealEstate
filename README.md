Project Name:
          Acme Realty

Project Scenario:
          All customers will be asked whether they are buying or sellingproperty. Depending on their answer...Buyer: Selects what they want the property to contain (accessories, commercial/residential, size, type of house, etc.). Then the agency will show them a list of available properties based on these parameters. Then they buy/rent a property, and the bought/rented propertyis archived on an “archived properties” list.Seller:Puts up a propertyand lists its contents. The contents being the parameters buyers can use to search for properties. An appraiser looks at thepropertyand puts a price on it based on what the property contains. Finally, the house is put up in the database of “to sell” houses.

10/27/18 - Divided the GUI into three frames, an opening frame that asks if a user is buying or selling, a frame for buyers and a frame for sellers. It's stored in branch guiTake2 -Emily 

10/22/18 - I uploaded a sort of "skeleton" for the GUI in a branch "guiTake1". Contact me if you have any questions or ideas - Emily

10/22/18 - I uploaded the .java version of the Propery classes and added the cover page to our readme file. - Rich

10/17/18 - Hey guys, I uploaded the Property class and subclasses I was working on. They need work, but they should 
give us a starting point. I wanted their toStrings to be basic for file output reasons and maybe make it easier to
read the variables with less fluff. I only wrote default constructors, and will add more once we get a feel for how we 
want to populate each class. - Rich
